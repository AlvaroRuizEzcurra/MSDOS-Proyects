# MSDOS-Proyects

In this Repository you'll find my personal projects aswell as smal pieces of codes that could be usefull for any enthousiast of MS-DOS prgraming. 

I'll try to explain as much as I can in each code put, due to my native language, most of them will be in spanish and it will take some time to me for translate all the commentaries. 

In some cases, you'll have to execute programs as Administrator becaus some of the proyects can modify or delete files.

iNSTRUCTIONS:

  1- For each code, you'll copy it in a txt document and you will save it with the name of your preference + ".cmd" or ".bat" extension.
  
    Example:  
    
    ::(In a .txt file, you copy the following code)
    
              @echo off
              ::  @echo off avoid the program to show all the internal process
              echo Hello world
              ::  echo Prints the text "Hello world"
              pause>NUL
              ::  The program pauses with no output
              exit
              ::  The program exits
              
    ::Save as: Hello world.cmd

  2- Now, you just open the document you've just created and the program will run.
  
CAUTION: In some cases, the name or the file in wich you save the document will be specified in each code. Read it carefully to assure the correct performance of the pregram and avoid any problem.
